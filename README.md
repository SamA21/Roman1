# Roman1
A Roman Numerals Converstion Project 

The **public string ConvertNumberToRoman(int val)** method will take a number and convert to string of the Roman Numeral. 

Currently Works for up to 3999 above that it just adds multiple M Numerals as couldn't see a concret way of displaying 5k, 10k etc atm as when looked there seemed different notations. 

Also has a bunch of NUnit tests though haven't covered every combo up to 3999.
